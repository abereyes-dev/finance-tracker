# Finance Tracker 💰

A simple command-line expense tracker built with Python.

## Features

- Add an expense with name, amount, and category
- Save expenses to a CSV file
- Summarize total spending by category
- Calculate remaining monthly budget
- Estimate daily spending allowance based on remaining budget

## How It Works

1. User enters expense details.
2. Expense is saved to `expenses.csv`.
3. The program reads the file and calculates:
   - Total spent
   - Spending per category
   - Remaining monthly budget
   - Daily budget allowance

## Technologies Used

- Python
- File I/O
- CSV-style data storage
- Basic object-oriented programming (OOP)

## Future Improvements

- Add input validation
- Prevent invalid numeric entries
- Add date tracking for expenses
- Convert to a GUI or web app
